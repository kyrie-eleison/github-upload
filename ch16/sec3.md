# sec3. Nested Arrays and Structures

## Nested Structures
- structures as a part of a structure
- gather a related chunk of data into a bundle => easy to be called as a function argument

## Arrays of Structures
- an array whose elements are structures => can serve as a simple database

## Initializing an Array of Structures
- similar to 2-dim array initialization
- why? because we want to treat it as a DB of information that won't change during program execution
