1. Pointer Arithmetic

if int *p, p + j is equivalent to p + (j * 4) (as an address value) (int: 4 bytes)
if double *p, p + j is equivalent to p + (j * 8) (double: 8 bytes)

2. Array Variable as a Parameter

not only pointer variable = array variable in this case, but also it can be assigned a new pointer value

3. is an Array Variable a Pointer?

in fact, the C compiler converts it to a pointer when necessary
