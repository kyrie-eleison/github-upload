// sec4: Type Conversion

// implicit conversions: especially when it comes to operations involving different data types
// usually, narrower(few bytes to store) -> other (called 'promotion')

// integral promotion: converting types to the int type

// assignments: the right converts to the left

// casting: (type-name)expression -> avoids overflow / unary operator
